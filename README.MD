Assessment Description
React Mini-App Assessment (Dashboard + Hooks)

Goal: Build a tiny React app that lists items (e.g., “Projects” or “Tasks”), supports a search filter, shows an item details view via routing, and uses one custom hook for data access (mocked locally). Keep it simple but idiomatic.

Core expectations
• Modern React (v18+), Vite.
• Functional components + hooks.
• One custom hook (e.g., useProjects()).
• Basic routing for list → details.
• A controlled form input for filtering.
• A11y: at least one aria-\* attribute.
• A minimal test.
• Readme with run instructions.
